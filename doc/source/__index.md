# Ray Documentation

```{image} https://github.com/ray-project/ray/raw/master/doc/source/images/ray_header_logo.png
```

**Ray provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications.**

Ray accomplishes this mission by:

1. Providing simple primitives for building and running distributed applications.
2. Enabling end users to parallelize single machine code, with little to zero code changes.
3. Including a large ecosystem of applications, libraries, and tools on top of the core Ray to enable complex applications.

**Ray Core** provides the simple primitives for application building.

On top of **Ray Core** are several libraries for solving problems in machine learning:

- {doc}`../tune/index`
- {ref}`rllib-index`
- {ref}`train-docs`
- {ref}`datasets` (beta)

As well as libraries for taking ML and distributed apps to production:

- {ref}`rayserve`
- {ref}`workflows` (alpha)

There are also many {ref}`community integrations <ray-oss-list>` with Ray, including [Dask], [MARS], [Modin], [Horovod], [Hugging Face], [Scikit-learn], and others. Check out the {ref}`full list of Ray distributed libraries here <ray-oss-list>`.

## Getting Started with Ray

Check out {ref}`gentle-intro` to learn more about Ray and its ecosystem of libraries that enable
things like distributed hyperparameter tuning, reinforcement learning, and distributed training.

Ray provides Python, Java, and *EXPERIMENTAL* C++ API.
And Ray uses Tasks (functions) and Actors (classes) to allow you to parallelize your code.

```{eval-rst}
.. tabbed:: Python

    .. code-block:: python

        # First, run `pip install ray`.

        import ray
        ray.init()

        @ray.remote
        def f(x):
            return x * x

        futures = [f.remote(i) for i in range(4)]
        print(ray.get(futures)) # [0, 1, 4, 9]

        @ray.remote
        class Counter(object):
            def __init__(self):
                self.n = 0

            def increment(self):
                self.n += 1

            def read(self):
                return self.n

        counters = [Counter.remote() for i in range(4)]
        [c.increment.remote() for c in counters]
        futures = [c.read.remote() for c in counters]
        print(ray.get(futures)) # [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

```{eval-rst}
.. tabbed:: Java

    First, add the `ray-api <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ray/ray-api>`__ and `ray-runtime <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ray/ray-runtime>`__ dependencies in your project.

    .. code-block:: java

        import io.ray.api.ObjectRef;
        import io.ray.api.Ray;

        import java.util.List;
        import java.util.stream.Collectors;

        public class RayDemo {

          public static int square(int x) {
            return x * x;
          }

          public static class Counter {

            private int value = 0;

            public void increment() {
              this.value += 1;
            }

            public int read() {
              return this.value;
            }
          }

          public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Intialize Ray runtime.
            Ray.init();
            {
              List<ObjectRef<Integer>> objectRefList = new ArrayList<>();
              // Invoke the `square` method 4 times remotely as Ray tasks.
              // The tasks will run in parallel in the background.
              for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                objectRefList.add(Ray.task(RayDemo::square, i).remote());
              }
              // Get the actual results of the tasks with `get`.
              System.out.println(Ray.get(objectRefList));  // [0, 1, 4, 9]
            }

            {
              List<ActorHandle<Counter>> counters = new ArrayList<>();
              // Create 4 actors from the `Counter` class.
              // They will run in remote worker processes.
              for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                counters.add(Ray.actor(Counter::new).remote());
              }

              // Invoke the `increment` method on each actor.
              // This will send an actor task to each remote actor.
              for (ActorHandle<Counter> counter : counters) {
                counter.task(Counter::increment).remote();
              }
              // Invoke the `read` method on each actor, and print the results.
              List<ObjectRef<Integer>> objectRefList = counters.stream()
                  .map(counter -> counter.task(Counter::read).remote())
                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
              System.out.println(Ray.get(objectRefList));  // [1, 1, 1, 1]
            }
          }
        }
```

```{eval-rst}
.. tabbed:: C++

    | The C++ Ray API is currently experimental with limited support. You can track its development `here <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/milestone/17>`__ and report issues on GitHub.
    | Run the following commands to get started:

    | - Install ray with C++ API support and generate a bazel project with the ray command.

    .. code-block:: shell

      pip install "ray[cpp]"
      mkdir ray-template && ray cpp --generate-bazel-project-template-to ray-template

    | - The project template comes with a simple example application. You can try this example out in 2 ways:
    | - 1. Run the example application directly, which will start a Ray cluster locally.

    .. code-block:: shell

      cd ray-template && bash run.sh

    | - 2. Connect the example application to an existing Ray cluster by specifying the RAY_ADDRESS env var.

    .. code-block:: shell

      ray start --head
      RAY_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:6379 bash run.sh

    | - Now you can build your own Ray C++ application based on this project template.
